# Pizza-Shack

Create a management system for ordering a Pizza. You will use a form with checkboxs for toppings, the order total, and an order button to build a pizza. Your pizza will be a form with inputs that have their type set to checkbox. You can submit the form to order the pizza. If you would like a challenge, you can use the onchange attribute on each input to update the total as you add each topping.

The class for pizza will have a list of toppings and a total.

The class for toppings will have a name and a price.
